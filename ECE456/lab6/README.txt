Assignment: Lab 6

This lab has been written entirely in Python3. It will need to be installed to run the programs.

Make the files executable by running `chmod +x <file>` on each python file.

Run the following:
    `./rcmdd <port no.>`
    `./rcmd <hostname> <port no.> <execution count> <time delay (s)> <command>`
